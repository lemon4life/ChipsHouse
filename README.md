## About the Game

This project started as a **birthday surprise** for a dear friend.  
It’s a **2D hand-drawn animation-based mini adventure** set in a warm, quiet bedroom.

You can **move the character** around, **interact with the environment**, and even discover a few secrets hidden in plain sight...

> 💡 *Hint: Try clicking the light switch near the bed. There might be a hidden button there!*
